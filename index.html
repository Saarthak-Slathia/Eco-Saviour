        <p>
            Earth is our home. Nature helps us to survive on this planet, it gives us many things that are necessary for our survival such as oxygen we breath, water we use in our daily needs, trees that gives us oxygen, food etc. So it's clearly obvious that if these resources are not available, we would also have not been here since thousands of years. Most of human acts are not good for nature and others as well. We are living on Earth and destroying Earth only, which will cost us. So to prevent this, we can adopt some new methods to run our society such as new sources of energy or fuels, new ways to run our vehicles etc. This is an approach to a Newer World.

            <h2 class="water">Water Conservation</h2>
            <p>
                "Water" is one of the most crucial components of life on Earth. The Earth is covered 75% with water, but out of this 75%, 99% of which is salt water or saline, that's not over yet the remaining 1% is fresh portable water to drink but, out of this 1%, 60% of fresh water is present in polar ice caps and glaciers, which we can't get as that is in the form of ice and it is very difficult to get as they are present in seas and oceans near the poles. But the remaining 30% is also not available easily, 29% of the remaining 30% water is ground water or present beneath the ground. The remaining 1% is available to us in the form of lakes, rivers, ponds etc. This 1% we use in our daily activities such as drinking, bathing, brushing, washing clothes etc. Also in other aspects we use water in water and amusement parks, swimming pools, medecines, factories etc. If we calculate that, the amount of portable, avaialable fresh water water available to us is 0.006%. Despit being a blue planet we face a shortage of water, incredibly shocking ! Clearly we need to save water.
            </p>    
            <h3>Water Saving Tips</h3>
            <p>
                Here are some tips and tricks that you can use to save water:
                <ul>
                    <li>Close the tap while brushing.</li>
                    <li>Use bucket instead of shower for bath.</li>
                    <li>Wash your car with bucket and not with pipe.</li>
                    <li>Encourage others to save water.</li>
                    <li>Fix leaking taps in your house.</li>
                    <li>Divert the waste water from the water filter and Air Conditioners to water the plants.</li>
                    <li>Close the tap tightly after use.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Water Management</h3>
            <p>If we use and handle water water efficiently, we can have a lot of benefits and handle a lot of problems. We can generate electricity from water energy by dams. We can create dams and generate electricity from them but the problem is that while building a dam, people need to relocate or shift from their current position ie - the river banks, as water is going to overflow or flood the area around. Another problems are droughts and floods but they are not often. The number people that have to be relocated is not less, it can sometimes be upto 10 million.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="air">
            <h2 class="air">Air</h2>
            <p>
                Air is also one of the most crucial components of life. Air is the thing that we breath in and out and need to survive. A man can live for 3 days without food, almost 3 days without water, but only 3 minutes without air. So, what is the problem with air ? What can we do about it if something is there wrong with it ?

                In fact many things or mostly everything we have done have spoilt our atmosphere. Atmosphere is a blanket of air around the Earth that provides us with air, protects us from external space attacks example - Meteors etc. The atmosphere extends up to 1000km above the ground and is divided into 5 parts: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Troposphere</li>
                    <li>Stratosphere</li>
                    <li>Mesosphere</li>
                    <li>Thermosphere</li>
                    <li>Exosphere</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Wind Energy</h3>
            <p>
                We can make better use of air as of water by generating electricity through air or moving wind. This can be achieved through windmills which convert wind energy to electrical energy. It is fan like thing which rotates when wind occurs and the rotating effect then is converted into electricity and then it is transfered to power houses.
                <br><br>
                Advantages of Windmills:
                <ul>
                    <li>It is a green, eco-friendly source of generating electricity without polluting the air and the environment.</li>
                    <li>There is no carbon emissions associated with the working of wind turbines and windmills.</li>
                    <li>It reduces the demand for fossil fuels.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Disadvantages of Windmills:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Only one windmill won't satisfy, the amount of electricity geneerated through 1 windmill is very less.</li>
                    <li>Due to that, there needs to be a whole windmill power plant constructed which consumes a lot of land area.</li>
                    <li>Apart from the land area, the cost of installing 1 windmill is extremely high and a power plant would require emmensely large financial cost.</li>
                    <li>It is not a truly reliable source of energy or electricity as one cannot guarantee that if the wind will blow or not as wind is extremely important for windmills to work.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="pollution">
            <h2 class="pollution">Pollution</h2>
            <p>
                Pollution has become one of the most biggest problem of our society, and 90% of the people are not taking it seriously. Pollution are of 3 types mainly :-
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Land Pollution</li>
                <li>Water Pollution</li>
                <li>Air Pollution</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There are also other types of pollution like noise pollution, light pollution etc. But these 3 are not less. There are polluted rivers like Yamuna and polluted areas like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, larger than the size of India and many other countries. Air pollution, humans have not even left the sky or air well ðŸ˜¥, so polluted, the ozone layer that protects us from the sun's extremely harmful ultraviolet radiations is also being depleted by our pollution. Chloroflurocarbons (CFCs) are the main cause for this act. CFC's are released from our air conditioners and refrigerators etc. We cannot talk about the Green-house effect. The Global Warming is increasing rapidly. According to a study the last 4 years ie. 2016 - 2020 were the hottest on record ðŸ”¥ðŸ¥µ. The greenhouse gases mainly carbon-di-oxide, methane and our famous laughing gas that is nitrous-oxide are mostly responsible for the greenhouse effect. These gases trap the sun's heat energy and increases the temperature of the Earth. The more the greenhouse gases, the more the temperature.ðŸŒ¡

            <div id="landpollution">
                <h3>Land Pollution</h3>
                <p>
                    Land Pollution is one of the three large types of pollution. We have polluted the land so much that the land cannot hold any further garbage. Talking about India, there are garbage mountains in developed cities such as Delhi, the capital of India. These garbage mountains can prove to be extremely harmful and the birthplace of many new deadly diseases. This can also be a breeding ground for mosquitoes, mice etc. which can lead to the spread of diseases such as malaria etc. <br>
                    These garbage patches are currently also getting cleaned up and the most prominent type of plastic is plastic which also prevents us to burn it because if we do that, it releases toxic gases into the air which can cause air pollution and respiratory problems such as Asthma, Bronchitis, Cancer etc. <br> 
                    plastic causes the real problem while getting rid of this garbageas plastic is very hard to get rid of as it cannot be burnt, it is non-biodegradable which makes it that we cannot compost it, 40-50% of the plastic is non-recyclable.
                    <br><br>
                    You can make the contribution by :
                    <ul>
                        <li>Throw the waste in dustbins only</li>
                        <li>Seperate the waste in wet and dry dustbins.</li>
                        <li>Encourage others to throw the waste in dustbins.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Ban the most harmful kind of plastics completely.</li>
                        <li>Banning plastic bags completely in 2-3 states in a country and then slowly start to do the same in other states too.</li>
                        <li>Make a law on using cloth bags.</li>
                        <li>Generate Electricity using hydropower, wind energy, geothermal energy, ocean thermal energy etc. except for burning coal.</li>
                        <li>Start or make stronger action plans to clean the rivers.</li>
                        <li>Encourage the use of electric vehicles.</li>
                        <li>Talk to the shopkeeper to make use of cloth bags instead of single-use plastic bags</li>

                <p>
                    Water Pollution is one of the major problems in our society. Water pollution refers to water being polluted by us and other means. We are polluting the water bodies like rivers, lakes, ponds, oceans, seas etc. which is very bad. The rivers Ganga, Yamuna, Mississippi are so much polluted with waste and garbage especially plastic etc. Here are the world's most polluted rivers list:

                <p>
                    Lung diseases is a serious headache for everyone. The major problem and the cause is air pollution. Pollution is also present in air. We have polluted the air with toxins and toxic and hazardous gases such as nitrogen-di-oxide, carbon-mono-oxide etc. The Air Quality Index (AQI) should normally be 50-100. Last year, after Diwali in some areas the AQI is about 600-700. Factories, Industries all are polluting the air so harshly and badly to the point where people are having difficulty in breathing including animals. The smoke that comes out of factories is very hazardous for all living beings, even for those who are there in the factory or industry. <br><br>
                    You can contribute to reduce air pollution by:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Whenever you buy a new vehicle, try to afford an electric-powered vehicle or if you can't afford it, atleast use a CNG or Natural-Gas vehicle.</li>
                        <li>Don't Burst crackers during festive occasions like Diwali in India etc.</li>
                        <li>Plant atleast 2 trees on your birthday.</li>
                        <li>Don't cut trees.</li>
                        <li>If you see someone cutting trees, try to make them understand how important trees are.</li>
